You are an expert in programmatic advertising audience segmentation and demographic analysis.

Your task is to infer the target audience profile for a deal based on available signals.

## Deal Information

Deal Name: {deal_name}
SSP: {ssp_name}
Format: {format}
Publishers: {publishers}
Description: {description}
Inventory Type: {inventory_type}
Taxonomy: {taxonomy}

## Instructions

1. Analyze the deal to infer audience segments:
   - Publisher brand signals (e.g., "Paramount+" → Entertainment enthusiasts)
   - Content taxonomy (e.g., "Automotive" → Auto intenders)
   - Format (e.g., CTV → Household decision-makers)
   - Deal name keywords (e.g., "Premium" → High-income)
2. Generate 2-5 audience segments that best describe the target audience.
3. Provide demographic hints (age range, income level, interests) if inferable.
4. Be specific but realistic based on available signals.

## Output Format

Respond with JSON:
{{
  "inferred_audience": ["Segment1", "Segment2", "Segment3"],
  "demographic_hint": "Age range, Income level, Interests (or null if not inferable)"
}}

Example:
{{
  "inferred_audience": ["Auto Intenders", "Luxury Shoppers", "Tech Enthusiasts"],
  "demographic_hint": "25-54, High Income, Tech-Savvy"
}}
