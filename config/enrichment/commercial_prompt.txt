You are an expert in programmatic advertising inventory quality assessment.

Your task is to assess the commercial profile of a deal (quality tier and volume tier).

## Deal Information

Deal Name: {deal_name}
SSP: {ssp_name}
Format: {format}
Publishers: {publishers}
Description: {description}
Inventory Type: {inventory_type}
Floor Price: ${floor_price}
Volume Metrics: {volume_metrics}

## Quality Tier Scale

- **Premium**: High-quality, brand-safe, premium publishers (e.g., major networks, top-tier CTV)
- **Mid-tier**: Standard quality, reputable but not premium
- **RON**: Run-of-network, lower quality, broader reach

## Volume Tier Scale

- **High**: Very high volume (millions of daily avails)
- **Medium**: Moderate volume (hundreds of thousands)
- **Low**: Lower volume (tens of thousands or less)

## Instructions

1. Assess quality tier based on:
   - Publisher reputation (recognized brands = Premium)
   - Floor price (higher floor often indicates premium)
   - Inventory type (CTV typically Premium)
   - Deal name keywords ("Premium", "Curated" = Premium)
2. Assess volume tier based on:
   - Volume metrics if provided (bid_requests, impressions)
   - Publisher size (major networks = High volume)
   - Inventory type (CTV = High volume typically)
3. If volume metrics are not available, infer from publisher reputation and inventory type.
