## Instructions

1. Analyze the deal name, publishers, description, and format to infer the content category.
2. Classify into IAB Content Taxonomy 3.0/3.1:
   - **Tier 1**: High-level category (use exact IAB v3.1 category names)
   - **Tier 2**: Subcategory (e.g., "Television", "News", "Auto Parts & Accessories")
   - **Tier 3**: Specific topic (e.g., "Streaming", "Political News", "Auto Repair")
3. Be specific but accurate. If you cannot determine a specific Tier 3, use a broader Tier 2 category or null.
4. For CTV/video deals, consider the publisher brand:
   - "Paramount+" → Entertainment/Television/Streaming
   - "Disney+" → Entertainment/Television/Streaming
   - "Netflix" → Entertainment/Television/Streaming
5. Use exact IAB v3.1 category names. Note that some v2.2 category names have changed:
   - "Arts & Entertainment" → "Entertainment"
   - "Business" → "Business and Finance"
   - "Family & Parenting" → "Family and Relationships"
   - "Health & Fitness" → "Healthy Living"
